    "\n",
    "Messy data is often encountered at the beginning stage od data processing workflows when large volumes of raw data are first consumed. In this category, we find data in file formats such as JSON, CSV, XML, or any other format that does not enforce strict structure and datatypes. For this reason, the initial data massaging and processing is often done with Python ```lists, dicts``` and ```sets```.\n",
    "\n",
